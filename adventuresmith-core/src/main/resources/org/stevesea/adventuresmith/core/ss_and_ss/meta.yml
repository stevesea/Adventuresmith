  stories by such authors as Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith, H.P. Lovecraft, Fritz Leiber
  and Michael Moorcock. With this book, you and your friends will be able to play exciting adventures
  with bold barbarians, witty thieves and cunning sorcerers without worrying about complex rules and

  was designed to be have its own unique system, more suitable to the Sword & Sorcery genre the
  author has in mind. The following author's work inspired the mechanics of this game: Gary Gygax,
  Dave Arneson, David Black, Christian Mehrstam, John Cocking, Peter S. Williams, Joseph Goodman,
  Harley Stroh, Jason Morningstar, Ian Livingstone, Steve Jackson, Simon Washbourne, Kevin Crawford,
