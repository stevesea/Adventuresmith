<blockquote>
Style And Substance: Enhance your games of the dark future, with the easy to use Augmented Reality
cyberpunk city kit. Inside, you’ll find over 50 tables designed to assist gamesmasters who need to
improvise futuristic city details, or who have found that they are unprepared for where their players are heading.
<p>With this book, you can add layers of detail to any cyberpunk cityscape, and make use of over
250 NPCs, including fixers, street samurai, corporate players and insane hackers, along with easy
to roll cabbies, cops, gang members and street fighters. Missions, motivations and methods can be
generated, along with the immediate urban environment, all painted with a broad brush, to enable
gamesmasters to let their twisted imaginations shine through, without slowing down the action.</p>

<h5>CRGE, Conjectural Roleplaying GM Emulator</h5>

<br/><a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145426/CRGE-Conjectural-Roleplaying-GM-Emulator">CRGE on DriveThruRPG</a>
<blockquote>
<p>CRGE is a GM emulator that works on adding the unexpected to your imagination. CRGE is a
tiered system to create a role-playing experience without a GM. At the base level the system
works to answer "yes or no" questions while constantly pushing the game towards the unexpected.
At the intermediate level, the system weaves story threads together to give each scene a focus
in advancing a specific narrative. At the high level, CRGE provides frameworks to tell complete
stories by yourself, with a group of friends, or even online.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>UNE is the Universal NPC Emulator. With just a handful of dice rolls, UNE can help create a
surprising non-player character (NPC) with its own motivations. A few more dice rolls, and UNE
can provide more direction to place the newly-created NPC smack dab in the center of the story.
It can even help determine the NPC’s general mood towards the player characters.</p>

<p>BOLD is the book of legends and deeds. With just a handful of dice rolls, BOLD can generate
interesting character histories, downtime events, and even adventures. Any character instantly
obtains deeds and legends that are overcome in unexpected ways. These deeds can even arc out
in to entire stories.</p>

<h4>What is Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells?</h4>
<p>Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells is a rules-light, sword & sorcery, old school role playing game
inspired by the original fantasy RPG and the Old School Renaissance movement as well as the
stories by such authors as Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith, H.P. Lovecraft, Fritz Leiber
and Michael Moorcock. With this book, you and your friends will be able to play exciting adventures
with bold barbarians, witty thieves and cunning sorcerers without worrying about complex rules and
tiresome preparations.</p>

<p>ATTENTION! Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells is not a Simulacrum of an older edition of the world’s
most famous fantasy RPG! Although inspired by the original game and the OSR movement, the game
was designed to be have its own unique system, more suitable to the Sword & Sorcery genre the
author has in mind. The following author's work inspired the mechanics of this game: Gary Gygax,
Dave Arneson, David Black, Christian Mehrstam, John Cocking, Peter S. Williams, Joseph Goodman,
Harley Stroh, Jason Morningstar, Ian Livingstone, Steve Jackson, Simon Washbourne, Kevin Crawford,
Sandy Petersen, Mike Manson, Jay Little, James M. Spahn, Ben Milton.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our tables are meant to supplement what's in the various editions of the DMG and PHB, cover
ground that the tables in the books do not cover, or replace what's in the books for situations
where it's cumbersome to flip through several tables in several locations within the book all at once.
</p>
<p>
Our PRIMARY GOAL is to build a searchable, linked repository of tables for adding fun, flavor, and
story to your D&D game.
<br/>
<br/>Our SECONDARY GOAL is to create a repository of these tables in the form of one-page
printable cheat sheets for use at the gaming table free of laptop, tablet, and other electronic screens.

<blockquote>
In 1977, TSR published the first introductory set for Dungeons & Dragons. This Basic Set
included a monochrome blue rulebook (the Blue Book) edited by Dr. J. Eric Holmes from the
original D&D booklets (the Little Brown Books) by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, and the first
supplements. Holmes also created a Sample Dungeon for the rulebook in which novice adventurers
from Portown explore the dungeon beneath the ruined tower of the wizard Zenopus.
This set served its role ably until 1981 when it was replaced by a revised Basic Set.
Some still find Holmes Basic, as the rules are popularly known, to be a concise 48-page
introduction to OD&D or AD&D, and others have been inspired to use it as the basis for
expansion to an entire game of its own. Many gamers involved in the current
"Old School Renaissance" (OSR) started with the Holmes Set.
